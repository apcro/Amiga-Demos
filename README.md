# Amiga Demos

Amiga source code for three issues of _Defy_, an Amiga disk magazine from 1994/1995 from the demo group [Cydonia](http://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=845), and the source to _Scrapbook_, a slideshow mag coded for the demo group Sect.

There is also the source to an un-released demo called 'Black Moon'.

Unfortunately the original includes and binary files have been lost.
